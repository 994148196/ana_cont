ana_cont: Package for analytic continuation of many-body Green's functions
=====

This is still a beta version, changes in the user interface cannot be excluded currently.
The main features have been tested extensively already and seem to work well. However, as
in any code, there might still be some minor bugs. 

Any questions, suggestions and bug reports will be received gratefully.
